        7; 7 Plus; 8; 8 Plus; X; XS; or XS
        Max).

        <h1>Information</h1>

        <p>
            (This is a demo version of the application; more or less compatible with all devices.)
        </p>

        <p><b>Aim:</b>
            <br>We are checking how we can record "touch force" data with the 3D Touch technology on certain iPhones. Later on we might be able to use this for interesting psychological measurements.
            <br>Participants have to respond with touchscreen presses to items appearing on the screen.
        </p>

        <p><b>Payment:</b>
            <br>
            The task takes around 3 minutes.
            <span id="pay_info">

                    We could not detect your Prolific ID!
                </b> Therefore we will assume that this is a voluntary testing and you will not receive payment. If you are trying to do this test as a job via Prolific and want to be
                compensated, you should open the proper link provided.
            </span>
        </p>

        <p><b>Rights:</b>
            <br>You can stop participating in the study at any time without giving a reason (by closing or refreshing this website). In this case, all recorded data will be fully deleted.
            <br>This application was tested thoroughly, but we cannot guarantee that it will correctly work with your specific iPhone and iOS technology. Please contact lkcsgaspar@gmail.com if you run into any trouble.
        </p>

        <p><b>Anonymity and Privacy:</b>
            <br>The results of the study (touch force data) are used and published for research purposes. The data do not provide any information about you personally. Your identity will be kept strictly confidential.
        </p>

        <p><b>Consent:</b>
            <br>By clicking the "Consent & Continue" button, you declare that you have read and understood the information above. You confirm that you will be concentrating on the task and complete it to the best of your abilities.

        <h1>Instructions</h1>

        <p>
            Please place your iPhone on a table (or other solid surface).
        </p>
        <p>
            During the task, you will see two buttons at the bottom of the screen, both like the one below.
        </p>

        <div class="btn_class" style="position: relative;transform:none;">
        </div>

        <p>
            Throughout the task, please hold your left index finger on the left button, and your right index finger on the right button.
        </p>

        <p>
            Each one or two seconds, in each trial, there will be a left arrow (←) or a right arrow (→) displayed on the screen. Whenever an arrow appears, please shortly press down on the correct button: the left button for left arrow, the right
            button for right
            arrow.
        </p>

        <p>
            For a full response, you need to reach 75% pressure on the button. To help you during the following practice round, your current finger pressure is shown in a dynamic bar above each button. (These bars will not appear in the subsequent
            task.) Don't be afraid to press hard: iPhones are designed to easily record up to the 100% pressure.
        </p>

        <p>
            To end the response (and let the next trial start), you need to lighten the pressure below 25% on the button. (If you accidentally lift your finger from the screen, it is alright, but the task will pause and a warning message will appear.
            The task will continue as soon as you put your finger back.)
        </p>

        <p>
            Start the practice with the <b>Start</b> button below. On the next screen, the arrows will begin to appear as soon as you placed both your fingers on the touch buttons.
        </p>

        <br>
        <button type="button" onclick='begin();'>Start</button>
        <br>
        <br>
    </div>

    <div id="instructions2_id" class="longtext" style="display:none;">
        <p>
            For the rest of the task, on some of trials, very shortly after the arrow appears, a "STOP!" message will also appear above the arrow. When this happens, please try your best to stop your response and <i>not press</i> any button on that
            trial.
        </p>

        <p>
            It is normal and expected if you will not always be able to successfully stop when a "STOP!" message appears. However, if you continue to try very hard to stop when a "STOP!" message appears, you
            should be able to stop sometimes.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>
                Please balance the requirement to respond quickly and accurately to the arrows while trying very hard to stop to the "STOP!" message.
            </b>
